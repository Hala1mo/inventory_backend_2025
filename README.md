The system provides several analytics features:

1. *Dashboard Statistics:*
   - Total locations count
   - Movement counts by type (IN, OUT, TRANSFER)
   - Total inventory count

2. *Product Location Report:*
   - Current inventory balance for each product at each location

3. *Category Distribution:*
   - Product distribution across different categories

4. *Location-Based Analysis:*
   - Product counts per location for warehouse utilization analysis
